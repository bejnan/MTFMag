Inherits Tree\-::\-Tree\-Root.



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class very similar to Tree\-Root. Only difference is Move\-Element method. It uses random factor influenced by different between elements to swap during moving element up.

Base algorithm is the same. If there is notification of element, algorithm tries to put it to top. During way up there is competition with elements to swap. If element looses, its parent tries to go up. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
